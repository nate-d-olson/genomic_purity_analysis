Project Plans
* Study authors - Nate, Justin, Jayne, Nancy

* Will send weekly updates with a summary of the results/ progress for the results section.  
* To facilitate revision process will send results and methods section complete drafts for review after second are completed.  
* Potential WERB reviewers - Jason Krajl, ???  
* Benefits - have text for introduction and methods (to some extent), current results and discussion sections are weak, and need to revisit.  
* Potential challenges  
    - Figuring out how to present contam results.  
    - Taxonomic match analysis/ contam classifications  - made progress earlier this week, just need to fix some minor issues
