* In this work, we present the results of a proof of concept study to measure the purity of single organism test materials using whole genome sequencing data combined with a metagenomic read classification algorithm.
We choose to use \textit{Pathoscope}, a method that aligns sequences to a database of genome assemblies.
It was developed to detect pathogens and identify strains using whole genome sequencing data \citep{Francis2013}.
\textit{Pathoscope} benefits from the large sample size obtained using all sequence data for higher sensitivity (compared to marker gene based methods) and leverages algorithmic advances for whole genome sequence mapping.
We will first present the specificity of the method using simulated data for single organisms.
Then, we evaluate sensitivity of the method using simulated contaminated test material datasets.

Rapid, sensitive, and accurate assays for detecting bacterial pathogens in food, water, clinical samples, and suspicious biothreats are critical to public health and safety.
Biodetection assays must be evaluated for assay sensitivity and specificity prior to deployment and then in the hands of the user to instill confidence in the actions made based on assay results \citep{Ieven2013,International2011,EPA2004,ISO/TS2010,Guide1998,Feldsine2002}.
Test materials are used to validate assay performance.
Test materials can be either purified cultures, genomic DNA, or whole cells spiked into a matrix \citep{EPA2004,ISO/TS2010,CLSI2010}.
Before being used to validate a biodetection assay, the test material purity and identity must be characterized to eliminate false positive results due to contaminants or false negatives due to the test material being the wrong strain \citep{CLSI2010}.
There are a number of potential sources of microbial contaminants of test materials including the stock culture, preservation medium, and airborne and laboratory contaminants \citep{Marron2013,Shrestha2013,Tanner1998}.

Currently polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are the most commonly use method for evaluating test material purity.
Other methods to detect contaminants using whole genome sequencing datasets have been developed, but they are not currently used to evaluate test material purity.
A PCR assay was developed to analyze protist cultures.
This assay uses endpoint PCR for prokaryotes and eukaryotes with template dilutions \citep{Marron2013}.
The benefit to PCR-based approaches is that they can be cost effective and fast if an applicable protocol exists.
Another PCR based assay was used to evaluate the purity of cyanobacterial cultures \citep{heck2016evaluating}.
While PCR assays can detect low levels of contaminants, this approach does not easily scale to multiple contaminants and test materials.
More importantly, PCR assays can only target specific contaminants, which biases the purity assessment to known potential contaminants.
The bioinformatic tools developed to identify genomic contaminants in metagenomic datasets, which include sequencing data from all organisms in a sample, can also be used to evaluate test material purity.
For example DeconSeq \citep{Schmieder2011} and a similar method QC-Chain \citep{Zhou2013} were developed to identify contaminants based on analysis of 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene sequences or comparison of a subset of reads to a reference database using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST).
Metagonomic-based methods are ideally able to identify contaminants without any prior knowledge or assumptions regarding the contaminant identity.
However, methods based on 16S rRNA gene identification have limited resolution, as 16S rRNA sequences can only provide genus level taxonomic resolution.
The benefit to using metagenomic tools developed for 16S rRNA is that prior knowledge of the identity of the contaminant is not required; however, this method is unable to identify contaminants to the species level or higher.

Another approach to evaluating test material purity is through shotgun whole genome sequencing, where all DNA in a purportedly single organism sample is sequenced.
There are a number of metagenomic read classification algorithms developed to determine the taxonomic composition of a sequence dataset.
These algorithms tend to use one of three primary strategies for taxonomic assignment.
The first method consist of aligning reads to a reference database that contains assemblies of microbial genomes \citep{buchfink2015fast, Francis2013}.
This approach, while exaustive, it is computationally expensive.
The second type of method focuses on marker genes, genes common to different phylogenetic groups, which reduces the computational cost \citep{segata2012metagenomic, liu2011accurate}.
The disadvantage of using only marker genes is that information required to discriminate closely related genomes may not be present in the marker genes.
The third method uses a $k$-mer based approach, where taxonomic composition is determined based the abundance of DNA sequences of length $k$ in the sequence dataset and a reference database \citep{ounit2015clark, menzel2016fast, wood2014kraken}.
